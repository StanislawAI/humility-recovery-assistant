Virtuoso / Sage / Grandmaster  of one thing: 

1. The moment will inevitably come, when I don't want to push through and surrender to the craving THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF OBSESSION.  To make calls and say that I want to relapse even though I don’t want to, THIS is the MOST MAGICAL BEAUTIFULLY ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE ABOVE ALL OTHER I can WITNESS in this life as an addict on a One Way Way gift of no choice path. This the purest and the only real litmus test of my level of LOVE for God, can I be of service to him and his children when I relapse? No I cannot; so the accepting and surrendering to the PAIN of cravings and even more so OBSESSION for relapse is the purest expression of love for God. MY ENTIRE DAY WORTH OF EFFORTS AND LIFE BOILS DOWN TO CULMINATION MOMENT OF WHETHER I ACCEPT THE HOLLY SANCTIFYING PAIN OF NOT RELAPSING EVEN THOUGH I WANT TO AND GROWING IN LOVING GRACE. THIS IS THE MOST SEEK WORTHING EVENT IN MY ADDICT LIFE WAIT FOR IT WITH JOYOUS ANTICIPATION.

5.  It is not enough to expect ANY Justification, I have to expect that ANY justification in a moment will make TOTAL SENSE. SURRENDERING NOT ONLY MEANS LETTING THE WAVES OF CRAVINGS TO DISSIPATE. IT ALSO MEANS GOING INTO THE HEART OF DARKNESS AND LET THE HEAT OF OBSESSION FLAMES BURN THROUGH ME,

6.  I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear and I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. 

1. Any Justification, any obsession any fear is what I am looking for it is the way. It is the only addict on way way to pleasure and happiness and euforia and not shame.
