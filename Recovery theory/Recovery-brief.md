# Emergency Card
- Call: sponsor + two allies
- Breathe 4‑7‑8 × 5; water; leave room; 10‑min walk
- Pray: Thy will, not mine; let it pass through
- Serve: one act for someone in 5 minutes
- Replace: meeting/podcast + 1 page recovery reading
- Timebox: 10 minutes; repeat; make no decisions while hot
- Remember: justifications will feel reasonable—do not negotiate

# Cravings Protocol
1) Announce urge to sponsor/ally (say the justification)
2) Move body (5 sec → 1 min → 10 min)
3) Breathe; change light/posture/room
4) Pray + gratitude scan; silver‑lining
5) Serve someone now; then reset environment
6) Repeat timer; debrief 2 lines

# If‑Then Plans
- If late night scrolling → dock phone in kitchen + read 1 page
- If lonely → call ally + 10‑min walk
- If win/failure → 3 gratitudes + 1 service
- If alone at home 30+ min → video meeting or leave house

# Daily Checklist
- Calls (15–20) + sponsor
- Meeting (camera on; share)
- Prayer rule (Mass/Rosary/Breviary/7 Sorrows/meditation)
- Body (lift/cardio/stretch/heat‑cold/breath)
- Mind (30 min: math/coding/philosophy/theology/art)
- Gratitude ×3; one service act

# Routines
- Morning: hydrate, light, prayer, movement, plan, first call
- Mid‑day: breathe, water, text sponsor, recommit
- Evening: reading, examen, inventory, prep tomorrow, prayer

# Triggers → Counters
- Isolation/late → call + light + water + walk
- Success/failure → gratitude + service + next small step
- Scrolling/boredom → block apps + distance + page reading
- HALT → protein + box breathing + call + nap

# North Stars
- Connection, prayer, movement, service—daily
- Weekly meetings and review
- Monthly step progress and amends/service review
