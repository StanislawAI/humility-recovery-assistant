The V1 app is a focused, tactical toolkit for the ""soldier."" The UI will be stark, simple, and centered around these three core feature sets.
Feature Group 1: ""The Crucible Protocol"" (Emergency Support)
This is the ""red button"" for when the storm of obsession is at its peak. It is the most prominent feature on the dashboard.
1.1: The ""15-Minute Covenant"" Timer:
Description: A large, unmissable button labeled ""BEGIN THE CRUCIBLE."" When pressed, the user is asked to make a simple, solemn vow: ""I commit to delaying any action for 15 minutes."" Upon acceptance, a 15-minute, non-cancellable timer begins, and the app enters a locked, full-screen ""Crucible Mode.""
User Story: ""When I am overwhelmed by obsession, I want to commit to a short, finite period of delay, so that I have a clear, manageable goal to hold onto.""
Technical Notes: This is the core ""delay"" mechanism. The UI must be designed to feel like a sacred, unbreakable commitment.
1.2: The Tactical Action Sequencer:
Description: During the 15-minute Covenant, the AI Oracle delivers a sequence of simple, one-sentence commands, one at a time. The user must manually check off each command to receive the next.
Example Sequence:
""Stand up. Walk to the kitchen. Now.""
""Drink one full glass of cold water. Now.""
""Go outside for 60 seconds. Feel the air. Now.""
""Open your phone contacts. Find your Sponsor. Now.""
""Press the call button. Now.""
User Story: ""When my mind is racing, I want a clear, external voice to tell me exactly what to do, so I can bypass my own compromised thinking.""
Technical Notes: The action library will be pre-defined and customizable by the user during their ""Warm"" state. Actions must be physical, simple, and break the user's current environmental and mental loop.
1.3: The Litany of Endurance:
Description: Displayed in large, clear text during the Crucible, and optionally read by the Oracle's voice, is the refined Litany of Surrender.
Text: ""I must not surrender to obsession. Obsession is the mind-killer. I will face my obsession and I will permit it to pass over me and through me. My mind is telling me this makes sense. It is a liar. The justification is not real. Only this moment is real. Where the obsession has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.""
User Story: ""While I am enduring the craving, I want to be reminded of the truth of the situation, so that I can re-frame my experience from one of suffering to one of endurance."""





1.1 The Entry Point: The ""Red Button""
UI Element: A single, prominent, unmissable button on the main dashboard. It should be visually distinct from all other UI elements.
Label: ""EMERGENCY: BEGIN CRUCIBLE""
Styling: A deep, solid red (#B91C1C) that subtly pulses, mimicking a slow heartbeat. This serves as a visual affordance that this is the primary ""action"" button for a crisis. It should not be a jarring, alarming pulse, but a slow, steady, reassuring one.
Location: Fixed position, probably position: fixed; bottom: 20px; right: 20px; or centered at the bottom of the viewport, ensuring it is always accessible, even on scroll.

1.2 The Vow Screen: The ""15-Minute Covenant""
Trigger: User taps the ""BEGIN CRUCIBLE"" button.
UI/UX: The app immediately transitions to a full-screen, modal view. All other navigation and UI elements disappear. This is a one-way gate.
Background: A dark, calming, near-black (#111827).
Text: A single, large, centered sentence in a serene, serif font (e.g., Liberation Serif).
Header: ""The Covenant""
Body: ""I promise myself, and I promise God, that I will not act on my obsession for the next 15 minutes. My only goal is to endure. My only task is to delay.""
Action: A single, large button below the text.
Label: ""I Agree. Begin the 15 Minutes.""
Interaction: Upon tap, the button provides strong haptic feedback (if on a mobile device) to confirm the commitment. There is no ""cancel"" or ""back"" button on this screen. The only way forward is through commitment.

1.3 The Crucible Mode: The Main Loop
Trigger: User taps ""I Agree.""
UI/UX: The screen transitions to the main Crucible interface. This is the core of the feature.
Layout: A single-view, full-screen interface with three components, designed for zero cognitive load.
1.3.1 Component A: The Countdown Timer (The Anchor)
Display: A large, prominent, and visually clear countdown timer, starting from 15:00. It should be the central visual anchor of the screen.
Styling: Use a monospace font for the numbers to prevent visual jitter as they change. The color should be calm but visible (e.g., a soft white or grey).
Behavior: It counts down second by second. There is no pause, skip, or cancel functionality. This visualizes the core principle: the ultimate tool is time.
1.3.2 Component B: The Litany of Endurance (The Mantra)
Display: Directly below the timer, the Litany text is displayed.
Text (Final Version):
I must not surrender to obsession.
Obsession is the mind-killer.
I will face my obsession. I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
Where the obsession has gone, there will be nothing.
Only I will remain.
Interaction (Optional v1.1): An audio toggle to have the Oracle's calm, steady voice recite the litany on a slow loop. The audio should be processed to sound non-robotic, with a cadence that is reassuring and hypnotic.
1.3.3 Component C: The Tactical Action Sequencer (The Engine)
Display: At the bottom of the screen, a single, clear, actionable command is displayed.
Data Source: The sequence of actions is pulled from the user's pre-defined ""If-Then Liturgy"" that most closely matches the trigger for this session (if tagged) or from a default ""Emergency"" sequence. In the V1 ""Wizard of Oz"" model, this command is pushed in real-time from the ""Sacred Proxy"" human council.
Interaction Flow: This is a step-by-step, blocking sequence.
The first command appears (e.g., ""Stand up. Walk to the kitchen."").
Next to the command is a single, large checkbox or a ""Done"" button.
The user must physically perform the action and then tap the button.
Upon tapping ""Done,"" the command is replaced by the next command in the sequence (e.g., ""Drink one full glass of cold water."").
This continues until the sequence is complete or the 15-minute timer runs out.
Technical Notes for the Coding Assistant:
The state of the current action step needs to be managed (currentStepIndex).
The action list is an array of strings: const actions = [""Stand up."", ""Walk to the kitchen."", ...];
The ""Done"" button onClick handler will increment currentStepIndex and re-render the component to show actions[currentStepIndex].
The UI should prevent the user from seeing future steps to minimize overwhelm. They only ever see the next indicated thing.

1.4 The Exit: The Victory Screen
Trigger: The 15-minute timer reaches 00:00.
UI/UX: The Crucible Mode screen fades out and is replaced by a simple, clean ""Victory"" screen.
Background: A slightly lighter, warmer color to signify the passing of the storm.
Header: ""Victory.""
Body Text: ""The storm has passed. You held the line for 15 minutes. You did not surrender. This is a breakthrough. Take a moment to feel the peace you have earned.""
Action: A single button labeled ""Log this Victory.""
Interaction: Tapping this button will navigate the user to the ""Victory Ledger"" feature (Feature Group 3) to complete the ""After-Action Report.""
