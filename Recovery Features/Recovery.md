# Recovery Plan (concise overview)

## Daily actions
- Calls: 15–20 support calls; stay in touch with sponsor
- Meetings: camera on / sharing; WhatsApp active; service positions (ANWA, prison, detox, conference)
- Prayer: Mass, Rosary, Breviary, 7 Sorrows, meditations
- Relationships ROI: family, friends, strangers, employers, self
- Body: weights, cardio, stretch, heat/cold, breath
- Mind: math, coding, philosophy, theology, art

## Highest-ROI strategy
- Choose service and connection over isolation; connection is the opposite of addiction
- Expect the built‑in forgetter and the disease’s “astonishing recuperative powers”
- Armor up: truth, faith, vigilance; be sober and alert
- 1% better daily; discipline equals freedom; every day is day zero

## When cravings or obsession hit (protocol)
1) Call sponsor / people immediately and say the quiet part out loud
2) Move the body: 5‑second rule → 1‑minute action → 10‑minute action
3) Breathe and ride the wave; let heat pass through without acting
4) Pray and surrender: “Let it go through me; only love remains”
5) Replace: serve someone now; gratitude scan; silver lining hunt
6) Reset environment: light, posture, water, walk, change room
7) Expect justifications to feel totally reasonable; do not negotiate

## Core principles (short)
- Pain now or pain later; growth requires chosen pain with God
- External mirrors internal; I receive what I am, not what I want
- Normal‑person fantasy must be continuously smashed; I am an addict with a gift of no choice
- Open‑mindedness, teachability, curiosity; discard old beliefs; question judgments
- Accept seemingly good and bad alike; nothing is wasted in God’s economy

## Full classification (VIA themes)

### VIA Purgative — Goodness acting with Faith

- Bodily Discipline: weights, cardio, stretching, heat/cold exposure, breathwork
- Mind Training: math, coding, philosophy, theology, art
- ROI Focus: family, friends, strangers, employers, self

### VIA Illuminative — Truth thinking with Hope
- Expert of One Thing: daily self‑knowledge; watch the “built‑in forgetter” and disease’s recuperative power

- Perspective Training: turbulence analogy; thoughts create magnified reality; craving waves pass
- Discipline: 5‑second → 1‑minute rule; day zero mindset; 1% better

4. Pray: “Let it pass through me; only love remains. Thy will, not mine.”
5. Serve: send a helpful message or do a 5‑minute task for someone
6. Replace: put on meeting/podcast; read 1 page step material
7. Timebox: set a 10‑minute timer; if still intense, repeat steps 1–6

## Advanced frameworks

### Anti‑fragile sobriety (stress inoculation ladder)
- Level 1: sleepy urge at home → use breath + one call + 10‑min walk
- Level 2: lonely evening → pre‑commit meeting + service text + early bed
- Level 3: travel hotel → device dock, meeting finder, sponsor check‑in
- Level 4: success high → gratitude ×5, service task, share in meeting
- Level 5: failure/shame → immediate inventory + call + walk + amends plan

### Systems over goals
- Identity: I am the kind of person who serves first and keeps promises to God
- Process: morning/meeting/service systems fire without motivation
- Environment: make the right action easy, wrong action hard

### Choice architecture (make good defaults win)
- Visibility: recovery materials front‑and‑center; triggers out of sight
- Effort: 1‑click access to meeting/podcast; multi‑step to risky apps
- Timing: vulnerable hours pre‑filled with safe activities

### Habit contracts and stakes
- Public commitment to ally; weekly report
- Small stakes (donation) on missed keystone habit; positive stakes on streaks

### Spiritual technology
- Examen: consolation/desolation notes; gratitude; course corrections
- Lectio divina: one verse; listen; respond; rest
- Intercession list; daily 60‑second prayer for others

### Cognitive tools
- Name it to tame it; urge surfing; defusion (“I’m having the thought that…”) 
- Opposite action; reframe to service; future‑self letter (read on high‑risk nights)

### Crisis triangle (body, mind, spirit)
- Body: breath + move + hydrate
- Mind: interrupt rumination; name distortions; tiny task
- Spirit: surrender prayer; scripture; call sponsor

## Personal commandments (draft)
1) Connection before isolation
2) Service before self‑seeking
3) Structure before mood
4) Prayer before performance
5) Honesty before image
6) Sleep before screens

- Boundaries: honesty > perfection; show up even messy; reschedule fast if miss
- Sponsee actions: daily check‑in (connection, prayer, movement, service, one insight)
- Sponsor actions: one prompt question; one encouragement; one concrete assignment

## Decision trees
```
Alone at night? → Yes → Phone in kitchen? → No → Dock phone now → Read 1 page → Sleep
                                 ↓
                                 Yes → Urge present? → Yes → Call + 4‑7‑8 + walk 10m → Pray → Sleep
```
```
Travel hotel check‑in → Remove temptations → Meeting finder → Text sponsor → Gym/walk map → Early lights
```
```
Win/failure spike → Gratitude ×5 → Service micro‑task → Share in meeting → Next tiny step planned
```

## Red-team rationalizations → counters → actions
- “I deserve a break.” → Deserve peace, not pain → 10‑min walk + service text
- “It’s not that bad.” → One decision leads to many → Call sponsor + timer 10m
- “I’ll start tomorrow.” → Day zero is today → Micro‑version now (2‑minute prayer + one call)
- “No one will know.” → I will know; God knows → Honesty text to ally now
- “Just a quick look.” → Urge surfing not indulging → 4‑7‑8 ×5 + leave room

## 30/60/90 day stabilization plan
- 0–30: daily meeting; 20 calls/week; strict sleep/digital hygiene; sponsor cadence 3×/week; service role secured
- 31–60: add sponsee/service depth; two weekly workouts minimum; step work milestone; weekly amends/service review
- 61–90: teach tools; chair/secretary option; relapse drills with ally; monthly retreat day; consolidate habits
Markers: streaks, meeting/service counts, sleep average, urge count trend, weekly reviews completed

## Recovery science notes
- Dopamine: spikes followed by dips increase craving; flatten the curve—consistent, low‑variance rewards (connection, exercise, prayer)
- Allostasis: repeated stress shifts set‑points; use predictable routines to re‑center
- Sleep: deprivation amplifies craving; protect circadian anchors (light, timing)
- Habits: cue→craving→response→reward; change cue and increase friction to response; pre‑load alternative rewards
- Exercise: acute exercise reduces craving intensity via catecholamines and mood regulation

(VIA Illuminative Humility Seeking Missile in Truth Thinking with Hope)  

Expert of one thing: Non negotiable everyday self knowledge awareness availed us nothing on its own as we have built in forgetter and ego with astonishing recuperative powers. We have an extremely powerful factory of all the neurotransmitters. Inside of us. We have the best drug store inside of us. It's all about developing awareness of how to activate it.   Connection is opposite of addiction  it limitless load If keep mining it for the rest of my life and insists on giving it up all away. Disease has astonishing recuperative powers, is cunning, baffling, and powerful  it has built in forgetter so Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light so Be alert and of sober mind, for your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.  If Camadeuli need MONASTERY bells how much more even me. 

 We have the disease so far ahead of us, it is like Big Blue playing chess with the toddler. Russel Crow beautiful mind movie, the person in the corner of the eye, it centers in mind, perception of it creates reality through great magnifying glass but it shall too pass.

Hard to start, hard to stop. 5 seconds 1 minute rule. Discipline equals freedom + Every day is day zero + Chop Wood Carry Water .The amount of pain I have to bear stays the same, the question is: Do I wanna do it now, later or in the next life. 1% better Breaking the habit of being my self one way way

The effortless master is only available in the middle of triangle, only then ride the pond waves. There is nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so.  God is everything or is nothing, nothing absolutely nothing happens in God's world for no reason, , The best things that happened in my life appeared to be the the worst thingsI will know that I have a measure of spirituality when i can accept seemingly good and seemingly bad in now

The Idea that we are like normal people has to be CONTINUOUSLY SMASHED, There is a way of monk, warrior, parent, and many others and there is a way of an addict It is a way of gift of no choice. Openmindedness + teachability + curiosity, Discard all old beliefs, entertain new ideas. Question judgments. 

Don't think about how hard it is to climb the mountain, but about what the view from the top is like. Pain is the cornerstone of spiritual growth Power Is Made Perfect in Weakness. Pain now or pain later, God stands for grow or die, Life is suffering, so choose something worth suffering for.

The single most important principle of this entire reality is this: My external world, in all its detail, is nothing more than a perfect, unerring mirror of my own internal state of consciousness. I do not attract what I want; I do not get what I deserve. I receive, unfailingly, that which I am. Remember that every time I use some bottomline, even a tiny thing, only then do bad things happen. This is a high, high level of awareness.

Observe my feelings and thoughts and my cue for beep radar to triangulate to humility seeking missile of Happy, Free, Joyous by Looking for gratitude and silverlining while being in perfect now Which principle I am not practicing currently with my affair, ask what would master do, think, see now


(VIA Unitive Humility Seeking Missile in Beauty Seeing with Love)  

Mastery of one thing:  : The moment will inevitably come, when I don't want to push through and surrender to the craving THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF OBSESSION.  To make calls and say that I want to relapse even though I don’t want to, THIS is the MOST MAGICAL BEAUTIFULLY ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE ABOVE ALL OTHER I can WITNESS in this life as an addict on a One Way Way gift of no choice path. This the purest and the only real litmus test of my level of LOVE for God, can I be of service to him and his children when I relapse? No I cannot; so the accepting and surrendering to the PAIN of cravings and even more so OBSESSION for relapse is the purest expression of love for God. MY ENTIRE DAY WORTH OF EFFORTS AND LIFE BOILS DOWN TO CULMINATION MOMENT OF WHETHER I ACCEPT THE HOLLY SANCTIFYING PAIN OF NOT RELAPSING EVEN THOUGH I WANT TO AND GROWING IN LOVING GRACE. THIS IS THE MOST SEEK WORTHING EVENT IN MY ADDICT LIFE WAIT FOR IT WITH JOYOUS ANTICIPATION. NAME OF THE GAME IS TO EXPECT ANY JUSTIFICATIONS AND EVEN MORE SO THE DECISION TO RELAPSE , EVERY TIME I PUSH THROUGH BY SURRENDERING THE OBSESSION I WILL EXPERIENCE A NEW LASTING BREAKTHROUGH LEVEL OF FREEDOM.

Cravings + External/Internal Toplines + Waves Dissipitatte > Obsession + Every justification convincing  + Expect Turbulence > Fear + Surrender to heart of darkness + Let it go through me = Euphoria + New Level Freedom +  Repeat Next cycle easier

Remember the turbulence in the airplane, how I managed to turn them around to be something exciting and looking forward. I feel like this is something like the obsession.

Everything is in an opportunity for growth in loving grace of humility which In my case mean not relapsing  I have good days and growing days, Allergy, Obsession,  Selfpity, Fear, Resentment, Accidents, Disease, Failures,  Irritability, Restlessness, Discontent, all of those are blessings in disguise for leveling up in sobriety.Letting go of one thing for gain everything else.

 It is not enough to expect ANY Justification, I have to expect that ANY justification in a moment will make TOTAL SENSE. SURRENDERING NOT ONLY MEANS LETTING THE WAVES OF CRAVINGS TO DISSIPATE. IT ALSO MEANS GOING INTO THE HEART OF DARKNESS AND LET THE HEAT OF OBSESSION FLAMES BURN THROUGH ME,

 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear and I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
